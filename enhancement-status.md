# PricePulse Scraper Enhancement Status

## Previous Enhancements

1. BigBasket scraper enhanced with:
   - Integration with modernScraperService.ts for extracting embedded JSON
   - New helper function extractBigBasketProductFromHtml for better HTML parsing
   - Improved proxy handling and error recovery

2. Swiggy Instamart scraper enhanced with:
   - Integration with modernScraperService.ts
   - Improved JSON data extraction from Next.js data structures
   - Better fallback mechanisms and HTML parsing

3. Meesho scraper implementation attempted but facing syntax issues

## New Enhancements (May 2025)

1. **Server-Side Scraping API**
   - Created a new `/api/compare.js` API endpoint to support price comparison across platforms
   - Updated existing `/api/scrape.js` to better handle Amazon product scraping
   - Made server-side scraping the primary method for both product and price comparison

2. **Client-Side Code**
   - Modified `ServerScraperService.ts` to use the API endpoints correctly
   - Updated `scraperService.ts` to prioritize server-side scraping over client-side methods
   - Fixed issues with proxy rotation and error handling

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Created a centralized environment configuration (`environment.ts`)
   - Secured API keys by using environment variables
   - Added flexible configuration for development and production environments

4. **Deployment Support**
   - Created a deployment script (`deploy.mjs`) to streamline deployment to Vercel
   - Added documentation for deployment and troubleshooting
   - Updated package.json with a deploy script
   - Added vercel.json configuration for optimized deployment

5. **Documentation**
   - Updated README with detailed information about the architecture and how to deploy
   - Added troubleshooting section to help users resolve common issues
   - Documented the multi-layered scraping approach

6. **Platform Expansion**
   - Added support for Myntra e-commerce platform for fashion items
   - Improved price comparison across four major Indian e-commerce platforms
   - Enhanced product data extraction methods

## Core Issue Addressed

The main issue with the application was that browser security mechanisms (CORS policies) were preventing direct scraping of e-commerce websites from the client side. By prioritizing server-side scraping through dedicated API endpoints, we bypass these restrictions since the server isn't subject to the same CORS limitations as the browser.

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Improved Reliability**: Server-side scraping is more reliable as it avoids browser-based limitations
2. **Better Error Handling**: Multi-layered approach with proper fallbacks for maximum data availability
3. **Enhanced Security**: API keys and credentials are better protected
4. **Easier Deployment**: Streamlined deployment process with automatic environment configuration
5. **Better Performance**: Server-side scraping is typically faster and more efficient
6. **Robust Monitoring**: Centralized error tracking and reporting system for all API endpoints

## Error Monitoring System

A new error monitoring system has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Centralized Error Logging**: All API endpoints now log errors to a central repository
2. **Admin Dashboard**: Admin users can view and manage error logs through a dedicated UI
3. **Detailed Context**: Errors include stack traces and contextual information for easier debugging
4. **API Access**: Secure API endpoint for programmatic access to error logs
5. **Role-Based Access**: Only admin users can access error logs

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement more robust error reporting and monitoring
2. ✅ Deploy the application to Vercel using the deployment script
3. ✅ Consider adding more e-commerce platforms to the price comparison feature
4. Monitor the application performance in production
