# PricePulse Scraper Enhancement Status

## Implemented Enhancements

1. BigBasket scraper enhanced with:
   - Integration with modernScraperService.ts for extracting embedded JSON
   - New helper function extractBigBasketProductFromHtml for better HTML parsing
   - Improved proxy handling and error recovery

2. Swiggy Instamart scraper enhanced with:
   - Integration with modernScraperService.ts
   - Improved JSON data extraction from Next.js data structures
   - Better fallback mechanisms and HTML parsing

3. Meesho scraper implementation attempted but facing syntax issues

## Next Steps

To properly integrate these improvements, we recommend:

1. Fixing syntax issues in the current implementation
2. Taking a more incremental approach to updating each scraper
3. Testing each scraper individually after implementation
4. Adding unit tests to verify the enhanced scraping capabilities

The core enhancements focus on:
- Using modernScraperService.ts for client-side rendered sites
- Better proxy rotation and error handling
- Improved fallback mechanisms when primary extraction fails
- Better detection of security challenges and rate limiting
